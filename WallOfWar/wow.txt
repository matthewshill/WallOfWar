Wall of War is a massive data visualization project by Dylan Halpern. Collaborators on the project include Lauren Thorson (faculty mentor), Tommy Petet (visualization programmer), and Matt Hill (app developer).

The original exhibition contained a 10'x85' printed visualization containing 463,461 entries from the Iraq and Afghanistan Wikileaks War Logs. The data
has been translated into a series of 220 graphic icons, each representing an kind of event.

This app was created as a companion to the piece--a way to decode the cells of information--and as a new way to look at and interpret the data. By following the highlighted input, you can decipher the icons and examine the data in its full form.

This project was made possible by a generous grant from the Robert D. Bielecki Foundation.
